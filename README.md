Steps to Run the Stock Selection Tool

Step 1: Copy the code for main.py from the document into Visual Studio Code and save it as a new file. Then, create another new file and paste the code for functions.py into it.

Step 2: Run the main.py file. Register an account for login by providing an email (ensure the email includes “@”) and a password. This step is necessary for successful login.

Step 3: Use the registered email and password to log in to the Stock Selection Tool.

Step 4: Choose the first category, where you will be prompted to enter a stock ticker and specify a date range for analysis.

Step 5: Once the results are displayed, you may choose to view the stored data if needed.

Step 6: After viewing the stored data, a file named user_data.csv will be created to store the results.

By following these steps, you can successfully set up, run, and use the Stock Selection Tool.
